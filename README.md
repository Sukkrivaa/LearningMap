  - Need to manage the fact that there are specific data types for specific input - eg cannot have strings as an order. Also need to make sure that topic names do not overlap - do this later when designing the modals.

-  We need to update MongoDB everytime the state changes - do this in index.JSX (do this tomorrow)

   - We need to check if all the orders match up
