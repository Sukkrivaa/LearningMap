To be done next
  - Need to manage the fact that there are specific data types for specific input - eg cannot have strings as an order. Also need to make sure that topic names do not overlap - do this later when designing the modals.
  - for now, set up the connection with MongoDB
    - get rid of the console.log statements used for debugging
    - add comments everywhere
    - use the schema instead of mongoose.insert (which has been depreciated)
    - Clear the database everytime so that you start testing on a new page (at least for now).
