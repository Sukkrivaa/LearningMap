To be done next
  - Need to manage the fact that there are specific data types for specific input - eg cannot have strings as an order. Also need to make sure that topic names do not overlap - do this later when designing the modals.

SANITIZE ALL INPUT FROM THE USER

//Need to warn them that any unsaved changes will be lost when clicking on a new subtopic - change this to periodic saving in the future


All console.logs are to be removed in production

All prompts are to be replaced with modals during styling

FIX STUFF WITH ESLINT ONLY AFTER YOU WRITE ALL THE TESTS!!!! - need to make sure your debugging does not break anything
