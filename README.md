To be done next
  - Need to manage the fact that there are specific data types for specific input - eg cannot have strings as an order. Also need to make sure that topic names do not overlap - do this later when designing the modals.

SANITIZE ALL INPUT FROM THE USER

//Need to warn them that any unsaved changes will be lost when clicking on a new subtopic - change this to periodic saving in the future


//Install karma and mocha


All console.logs are to be removed in production

All prompts are to be replaced with modals during styling

FIX STUFF WITH ESLINT ONLY AFTER YOU WRITE ALL THE TESTS!!!! - need to make sure your debugging does not break anything

When switching to a new subject need to change the active state to "".

Need a way to petition for more subjects

When signing in, you need to redirect to where you were - see if you can use hashHistory or something

You need to change the subtopics everytime the subject changes

start with just comp sci first and test out all the possible problems
  comp science is fairly active
  The different subjects can be the different languages and topics

install and configure prettier

install and integrate gulp or grunt

use travis CI so that you can see builds immediately instead of pushing onto heroku all the time.

install quokka.js

In v2, add spectrum so that people can make teams and collaborate
  - Instead of doing this yourself, get your team to do it. Get funding for this (Peter thiel fellowship if possible after first semester at NUS)
