To be done today
  - To get the ordering of the subtopics right when changing and setting order


Need to manage the fact that there are specific data types for specific input - eg cannot have strings as an order. Also need to make sure that topic names do not overlap. - cannot accept zero as well

change Unixcreated to unix updated

Need to make sure the order must be less than the total number of Subtopics
