To be done next
  - Need to manage the fact that there are specific data types for specific input - eg cannot have strings as an order. Also need to make sure that topic names do not overlap - do this later when designing the modals.

-  We need to update MongoDB everytime the state changes - do this in index.JSX (do this tomorrow)
  - we need to iterate over every property in the state and make sure they match
  - When a subtopic is added, we need to update the MongoDB by checking if it is there and if not, adding it
   - We need to check if all the orders match up
